# One Profile
An open source schema and toolset for consolidating your online profiles into a single document

## Problem as We See It
The current state of social media is a mixed bag of platforms that is constantly changing. If you want to actively participate you must maintain a profile acrossed numerous platforms. This requires time and energy to properly maintain these profiles and keep information in sync. It also makes joining new platforms tedious because you must now tranfer all the information you have into the new platform. 

## Our Solution 
Generalize information related to individuals into a schema. The schema will be able to accurately represent information that you would have on various media platforms. Things like your name, favorite movies, work history, etc. Identify colleagues and friends through common identifiers and link to thier social media profiles. Allow for a seperation between family, friends, colleagues, and other associates, which would automatically limit thier access level to your profile information. 

With a standard schema for representing digital profiles, many existing limitations can be solved. Platforms could create digestion API's, which would allow users to use thier One Profile as a living standardized digital profile. Users could consolidate multiple accounts into a single account. Users could update a single profile and potentially update all thier profiles at once with the new information. New platforms could easily onboard existing users and those new users would only need to upload thier latest profile.

## Goals
- Make consolidating profile information from various platforms seamless for users
- Make onboarding with new social media platforms seamless for users
- Make Updating profile information across platforms seamless for users

## Not Goals
- Discourage or promote the use of any social media platform
- Store or maintain any information about users of these tools
